Example - Part 1<br>
</h1>
This
page will guide you through the first steps of using your product
RXF_Rpy_CPP_V7.05_edu. The goal is to generate source code from an
included sample UML project with Rhapsody
<h2>Generating Code from the Rhapsody Model<br>
</h2>
<br>
<br>
Open the Rhapsody project Blinky from the directory<br>C:\DevTools\Willert\RXF_Rpy_CPP_V7.05_edu\Samples\Model\Blinky:<br>
<br>
Open the Components and select the RTOS you want to use.<br>
<img alt="" src="Images/GettingStarted/SelectComponent.png"><br>
Therefore perform a right click on your configuration you want to use and selct "Set as Active Configuration".<br>
<br>
<a name="Profiles"></a>The configuration
is using the stereotype <span style="font-style: italic;">RXF</span> which
is defined in the profile <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_Rpy_CPP_Profile</span>.
Each RXF by Willert Software Tools comes with its own profile with the
stereotype <span style="font-style: italic;">RXF.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">RXF</span> sets the proper
environment, some properties for the RXF and defines some Tags. The
referenced setting, <span style="font-style: italic;">WSTStyle</span>,
is used to set Rhapsody GUI details which makes it easier for you to
view and maintain your models. It does not influence the code generation.<br>
<br>
How the RXF can be configured in detail can be found in the section <a href="WST_2-Usage_7-RXF-Configuration.htm">"RXF Configuration"</a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
You can now press the button "Generate/Make/Run" in Rhapsody (or use <span style="font-style: italic;">Generate/Make/Run</span> entry from <span style="font-style: italic;">Code</span> menu) to perform these steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generate</span> source files.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Rhapsody will show several generated .cpp and .h files along with
a .bat file in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Log</span> tab.</li>
    <li>A successful code generation will end with the log entries "<span style="font-style: italic;">Code Generation Done</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">0&nbsp; Error(s), 0&nbsp; Warning(s),
0&nbsp; Message(s)</span>".<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Make</span> step
executes the generated batch file from the previous step. The batch
file generates a RXF configuration
file and than launch the deployer to embed the generated source files
into your IDE project. The building of the executable will be performed
inside
your IDE and must be executed by the user. The generated configuration
file is:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><a id="WST_CFG.h" name="WST_CFG.h"></a>WST_CFG.h
which is an include file which contains constants and defines to configure the RXF which are derived
from properties and tags set in the model like buffer sizes etc.<br>
The RXF can be configured completely by the model. No defines must be set on code level.
Therefore different models can use the same RXF wit different RXF configurations.</li>
  </ul><li>The&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Run</span>
step opens the cofigured IDE Project and in addition can be used by the
user to execute user defined applications / scripts. The Batch
File&nbsp;C:\Dev Tools\Willert\RXF_Rpy_CPP_V7.05_edu\Tools\RhapsodyRun.bat is executed in this step.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Deployer" id="Deployer"></a>WSTDeployer</h2>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>The WSTDeployer will deploy
Rhapsody generated source files the RXF configuration file WST_CFG.h into your IDE. 
Until now the generated source is independent from compiler and IDE.<br>
<br>
The first time you press the "Generate/Make/Run" button the Deployer window will automatically pop up.<br>
<br>
<b>First</b> select your IDE which you want to deploy to:<br>
<img alt="" src="Images/GettingStarted/DeployerSelectIDE.png"><br>
<br>
<b>Second</b> select your project file which you want to deploy to:<br>
<img alt="" src="Images/GettingStarted/DeployerSelectProject.png"><br>
<br>
An empty example project file you find under:<br>
&lt;RXF installation folder&gt;/Samples/Model/Blinky/IDEProjects/&lt;RTOS&gt;/&lt;Board&gt;/&lt;IDE&gt;<br>

<br>
The IDE Project Folders are sorted by RTOS and in each RTOS Folder there are different Bord Projects for different IDEs.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Be sure the RTOS selection made before in the Tags of RXF Configuration
matches the RTOS in your IDE Project. Otherwise the Framework Sources
will not work with the RTOS sources.</span><br>
<br>
<b>Third</b> Configure deployer options<br>
<img alt="" src="Images/GettingStarted/DeployerConfig.png"><br>
You can chose between two options: Copy source files into the IDE project or reference them into the IDE project.<br>
When you chose to copy them you can define here the name of the folders where they are copied to.<br>
<br>
After pressing OK the files are deployed into your IDE project and you
get information of the deployment into your Rhapsody console.<br>
<br>
<b>Info:</b>If you want to change the Deployer settings, open "Tools" -&gt; "RXF_Rpy_CPP_V7.05_edu Deployer Configuration"<br>
