<h1><a name="Software_Configuration_Management"></a><a name="SCV"></a>Software
Configuration Management (SCM)</h1>If
you work on one model with a team, its absolutly neccessary to put your
model into a config management solution. If you do this, a question
will be, where to put the RXF and from which location to include the
RXF_Rpy_CPP_Profile. The next steps will lead you throug our best
prectice aproach. Precondition is that your config management tool
supports externals - we use SVN and it works fine:<br><br>1. Install RXF to a folder that is available on every Developers PC (for Example C:\Willert or C:\DevToolsWillert)<br>2. Check in the Willert folder - This Folder has to be checked out to the same directory on each Dev PC<br>3. Check in your user model<br>4. Add the Config folder from your Willert RXF folder as external relative to your user model<br>5. Add the Framework Profile (RXF_Rpy_CPP_Profile) to your user Model from this external location.<br><br>Thats's it.<br><br>This
approach has the advantage that the installed RXF is under config
management to and you can easily switch versions by changing the RXF
version number in your external. Only the Willert folder has to be
checked out to the same directory on every Dev PC, the user model can
be checked out to any directory (if only relative paths are used) -
Nevertheless we would recomment to use same&nbsp;checkout directories
(and also same Tool Paths) on every Dev PC.
