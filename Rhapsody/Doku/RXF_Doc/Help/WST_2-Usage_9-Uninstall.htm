You may use the Windows control panel functionality to remove installed
software from your machine. Willert products can be removed one by one
this way. After all product specific files have been removed by the
Willert uninstaller during a guided deinstallation procedure, only the
folder C:\Dev Tools\Willert\Uninstall will stay on your system. It contains
information about all products and the associated deinstallations that
have been installed on your machine. You may remove the whole
C:\Dev Tools\Willert folder after deinstalling <span style="font-style: italic;">ALL</span> Willert products from your machine.
