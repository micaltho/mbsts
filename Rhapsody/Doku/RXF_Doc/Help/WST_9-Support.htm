  <h2><a name="Support_Attachments" id="Support_Attachments"></a>Attachments</h2>You should think about attaching one or more of the following files&nbsp;to your support email you send to <a href="mailto:support@willert.de">support@willert.de</a>, to enable us to quickly find a helpful answer:<br>

  <ul>
    <li>in general</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">screenshots</span> often help understanding your question.
        Please attach screenshots in JPG or PNG format.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>especially if you experience problems shortly after a product has been installed:</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">WST_Install_Log_&lt;date&gt;_&lt;time&gt;.txt</span>, containing detailed information about possible problems during RXF installation</li><li>&lt;your Rhapsody&gt;\Share\Properties\<span style="font-weight: bold;">Site&lt;Language&gt;.prp</span>, helpful if the installer had problems modifying this file</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>if you experience a problem that might be related to the WSTDeployer:</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside; display: inline;">
      <ul>
        <li>Tools\WSTDeployer\<span style="font-weight: bold;">WSTDeployerLog.txt</span>, containing a detailed log of &nbsp;everything that happened or went wrong during deployment</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The UML model
including needed external files, compressed as a ZIP archive. Often
there is no other way to answer your model specific questions than
looking at the model ourselves. If you may not send your model, the
model is too complex to easily describe when it goes wrong or if
special hard- and software is required for reproduction, you should
consider creating a tiny example model that lets you reproduce the same
problem and send the tiny one.</li>
      </ul>
