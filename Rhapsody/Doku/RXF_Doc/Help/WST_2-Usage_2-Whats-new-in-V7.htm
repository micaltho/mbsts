<h1><a name="RXF_Migration"></a><a name="V6_to_V7_Migration"></a><a name="V7_-_Whats_New"></a>What's New in V7 (Willert
RXF Version 7)<br>
</h1>
The
RXF is currently available in major version 7 and has been completely
redesigned as it is generated from a rhapsody model now. It allows
Willert
Software Tools to create more generic product releases. The
customer benefits from reduced dependencys to special components like
board, compiler, IDE and RTOS, which helps the customer to be more
flexible in the tool selection.<br>
<h2>Memory Management<br>
</h2>
RXF V7 has an improved Memory Management, which uses static Memory
Pools for internaly used dynamic memory allocation. This is faster and
more transparent than the old V6 Memory Management.<br>
<h2><a name="Tags_for_WSTDeployer"></a>WSTDeployer<br>
</h2>
The WSTDeployer is now independent of the IDE to deploy to what allows
one Framework to be used with multiple IDEs. Also the Deployer allows
selective Deployment of RXF Sources, which makes it possible to deliver
multiple RTOS adaptions with one framework.<br>
<h2>OXF Container Classes</h2>
As the deployer needs to deploy all selected Variants from Framework
Sources flat to one RXF directory, also the oxf container class folder
is deployed flat now. If include pahts like
&lt;oxf\omcollec.h&gt;,
&lt;oxf\omlist.h&gt; or &lt;oxf\ommap.h&gt; are added
manually to the
user model the have to be changed to &lt;omcollec.h&gt;,
&lt;omlist.h&gt; or &lt;ommap.h&gt;. For generated
code, this is fixed
automatically through the new Framework Profile.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Rhapsody_Integration_in_V7"></a>Rhapsody
Integration<br>
</h2>
No WST_RXF_V6.prp or WST_RXF_V7.prp file is required and included
in SiteC.prp or SiteC++.prp. Properties are now defined in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">RXF</span>
stereotype as part of the product specific profile.<br>
