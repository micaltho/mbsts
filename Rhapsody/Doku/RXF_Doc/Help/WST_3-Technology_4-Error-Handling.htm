<h1><a name="Error_handler" id="Error_handler"></a>Error Handling</h1>
Runtime errors in the RXF are handled by the error
handler <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_ERR::error()</span>.
The error handler will catch use of NULL pointers, lack of resources,
etc.<br>
<br>
The error handler function is called from several places in the Framework, the first argument
indicates the error that occured, the second parameter is not always used but for instance
in case of an RTOS failure, the RTOS error code is passed here.
<br>
<br>
The function <span style="font-style: italic;">WST_ERR::error()</span>&nbsp;is&nbsp;implemented
as an endless loop in the source file WST_ERR.cpp. It is strongly
recommended to provide an own error handler
implementation which fits your application needs.<br>
The recommended way to modify the error handler is using the RXFConfigurationPackage-Stereotype of this Framework:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new Package in you UML Model</li>
  <li>Apply the stereotype RXFConfigurationPackage to this Package. The
Package now is located under RXFConfigurationPackages and a Template
Implementation of WST_ERR is copied to this Package.</li>
  <li>Modify the Implementation of WST_ERR::error() to fit your needs.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Documentation of Enumerated Error Codes</h2>The error code names
are mostly self explaining and mostly used only in one or few places in
the RXF code. I you are manually debugging your code on source code
level it is recommended to look at the error code and use the call
stack feature or your debugger to examine where the error has occured.<br>
<br>
Detailed Documentation of the Error Codes is located in the RXF Model and can be found as comments in WST_ERR.h<br>
