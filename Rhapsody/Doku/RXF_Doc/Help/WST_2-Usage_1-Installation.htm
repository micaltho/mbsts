  <h1><a name="Installation_of_Product" id="Installation_of_Product"></a>Installation</h1>The
installation of a generic RXF by Willert Software Tools requires you to already
have installed:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Your Modeling tool IBM Rational Rhapsody</li>
</ul>
A release of an RXF always comes with a Setup,
which needs to be executed in order to install the RXF. It will ask you
for some program paths. It will copy files, expand macros inside files and
configure all tools. Since each RXF is installed in a
separate directory, there is no need to make a backup of a previous
installation with an older version number.<br><br>Its
highly recommended to have the RXF&nbsp; installed in the same
directory on every Developers PC. Use for example C:\Willert or
C:\DevTools\Willert. It also makes config management and collaborative
work easier. Read <a href="file:///C:/V7/Component/Core/CPP/Doc/Help/WST_3-Technology_9-Configuration-Management.htm">Configuration Management</a> for best practice config management with Rhapsody and the RXF.<br>
<br>
To install a product just launch <span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup.exe</span> and follow the steps which are displayed.<br>
<br>

<h2><a name="Installation_Problems"></a><a name="Setup_Problems"></a>Possible Problems During Setup</h2>
If you experience any problems, please first check the following possible solutions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have the necessary read/write access privileges in the destination directory or directories.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure you have enough disk space available.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Only Windows 7 and Windows 10 are supported operating systems.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Sometimes direct installation from or to a network drive, long source
path names and in rare cases directly from a DVD may cause problems. If
setup failed you may retry it after copying all files from the
installation folder (including "WILLERT" folder) onto a directory on
your local drive (e.g. "C:\Temp\WillertSetup\") and launching Setup.exe from there.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Setup will write an installation log file with helpful
information for our support team into the destination folder. It will
be named WST_Install_Log_<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;date&gt;</span>_<span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;time&gt;</span>.txt.
If Setup can not access the specified destination path to write the log
file, it will show this error message and try to write it to drive C:
in the root directory:<br>
    <img style="width: 444px; height: 159px;" alt="" src="Images/Installation_Error_WritingProtocol0.png"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The "WILLERT" folder beside Setup.exe contains all the files that will be copied to your
installation directory. But it will perform several operations on them
during installation like macro expansions, conditional operations, path
replacements etc. So please don't copy any files from the WILLERT
folder contents to your destination directory manually, always use
Setup.exe.</li>
</ul>
If these possible solutions do not help, please contact our <a href="WST_9-Support.htm">support</a>, if possible including the log file.<br>
<h2><a name="Installation_Directory"></a>Contents of an Installation Directory</h2>

There are some files and a folder located beside Setup.exe. This section briefly describes what they are.<br>

<h2><a name="Multi-User_Setup"></a><a name="Installation_Path"></a>Multi-User Setup with Windows 7<br>
</h2>
When installing the RXF in Windows 7 the default paths for the Willert
folder is located under the user's homepath. It is recommended if a single user
should work on one PC with the RXF and makes sure read/write access to
that directory is no problem. But if multiple users on one machine
should work with the RXF, it is recommended to install the RXF and also
other toolchains (like IBM Rational Rhapsody and your IDE and Compiler) directly in a dedicated
directory on the hard disk's root. For exaple C:\Willert\ or
C:\Dev\Willert. This makes sure these folders are accessible for all
users on most setups.<br>
